Note: When I originally started the repository, I excluded a README.md file, and had a single .txt file in the directory. Github did not seem to recognize the repository as cloned or linked yet?

This could either be because I had just changed my github username, (somewhat unlikely) or because it always searched for a README.md file and would not open with out it, as it linked the lone text file as the Read Me document. (Also seems unlikely, but more probable than the former.)
